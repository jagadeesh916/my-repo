            The Equal Opportunity Cell ensures the effective implementation of policies and programmes for the underprivileged section of the society. The Cell attempts guidance and counselling with respect to academic, financial, social and other facets of life. Our aim is to extend maximum support to the backward communities and create the opportunity for their maximum participation in various walks of life. The club creates a socially congenial atmosphere for academic interaction and for the growth of healthy interpersonal relationships among the students coming from various social backgrounds. We look into the grievances of the weaker section of society and suggest amicable solution to their problems.
